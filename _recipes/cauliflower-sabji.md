### Ingredients (Serves 6)

- 4 tbsp oil
- 2 tsp jeera (full)
- 1 1/2 tsp jeera powder
- 2 tsp dhanya powder
- 1/4 tsp haldi
- 1 tsp chilli (to taste)
- 2 onions
- 2 tomatoes
- 2 potatoes
- 1/2 medium sized cauliflower

- 1 tsp tomato ketchup (optional)

### Directions

Cutting vegetables:

- Cut onions into long strands - cut into halves and slice into thin slices from top to bottom.
- Cut the capsicum into medium sized pieces.
- Cut the cauliflower so that ot much of the stalk is taken. Take out the flowery portion. Make it medium size so that it is chewable.
- Cut the potato to medium bite sized pieces
- Cut tomatoes into smallish size, this will become pulpy when making the sabji.

Making sabji:

- Put oil in a kadai and heat it up.
- Add jeera into it and immediately add the onions. Let it fry till the onions start turning golden.
- Add the jeera powder, dhanya powder, haldi and chilli powder into it and mix so that the masala does not burn. Mix well.
- Add the tomatoes, mask it up a bit and close with a lid so that it becomes pulpy.
- After this, add potato, cauliflower and mix it up.
- Close the lid for sometime and let it simmer in steam.
- Add water if it becomes too dry while cooking at any time.
- Add a tsp of tomato ketchup to give it a bit of tangy flavour.
- Add the capsicum (can also add carrot) when the potato is nearly done.
- Let it continue to cook, when the vegetables seem cooked it's done.
