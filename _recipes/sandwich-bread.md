### Ingredients

Makes 1 small loaf. Not as big as Modern bread loaf, add 4 cups (increase other ingredients appropriately) if you want it bigger.

- 3 cups Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 to 2/3 cup hot water, enough to make a soft, smooth dough
- 1/4 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar
- 1 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 packet active dry yeast dissolved in 1 tablespoon warm water OR 2 teaspoons instant yeast

When using the Milk + water:

Mix cold milk with hot tap water to make a lukewarm liquid before adding to the remainder of the ingredients. Flour is like a sponge; it can absorb moisture from the atmosphere, so the amount of water you use can vary depending on climate and season. Use the lesser amount of water in the summer, or under humid conditions; the greater amount in winter, or when the climate is dry

When using the yeast:

Yeast comes in different forms:

- 1 teaspoon instant (aka instant active dry)
- is same as: 1 1/4 teaspoons active dry
- is same as: 1 1/2 packed teaspoons fresh cake yeast

So, for every 1 cup of flour use either:
3 gm compressed fresh yeast (0.1 oz, 1/6 cake)
2 gm active dry yeast (0.05oz, 1/2 tsp)
1 gm instant active dry yeast (0.04oz, 3/8 tsp)
