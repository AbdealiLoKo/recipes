### Ingredients

- 2 bunches of Spinach
- 1 tsp ginger garlic paste
- 1 Green chilli
- 1 medium Onion
- 200 gm Paneer
- Pinch of red chilli powder
- Fresh Cream

Directions

- Pluck the leaves of the spinach and wash them very well else the taste will be bitter.
- Put the leaves in some water (just enough to soak the spinach in) and put 1 green chilli in it, ginger garlic paste, 1 finely cut onion, and salt.
- Heat till the water boils, and keep it boiling for 2-3 minutes. Ensure that it does not get over boiled otherwise the spinach becomes very dark.
- Now take a blender and blend it into a paste.
- Cut the paneer into cubes.
- Red chilli powder, Cream, butter, oil
- Take some butter/oil and heat. Add some garlic and heat. When the garlic color changes to a golden, add a pinch of red chilli, salt to taste and the whole spinach paste in it.
- Add the paneer to it. and let it simmer for a few minutes.
- Heat, but don't heat too much otherwise the palak gets very dark.
- Add some cream to make it thick.
