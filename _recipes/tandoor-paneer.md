- 2 Capsicum
- 1 large Onion
- 3 tbsp curd
- 1/2 tsp Tandoor powder
- 1/2 tsp Jeera powder
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp Chilli powder
- 3/4 tsp Dhanya powder
- 1/4 tsp Haldi powder
- 1/8 tsp Red food coloring
- 1/2 tsp Pepper

- 1/2 tsp Sugar
- 1/2 tsp Chaat masala

### Directions

Cutting:

- Wash the paneer to remove the sticky coating normally present on top.
- Wash thevegetables.
- Cut the paneer to get bite sized pieces. Aprox 1cm x 1cm x 1cm
- Cut the capsicum and onions to bite sized pieces such that the size it similar to the paneer.

Marinate the paneer:

- In a bowl take curd and add some salt (1/2 tsp).
- Add some Tandoori masala, Dhanya powder, Haldi powder, Jeera powder and Red chlli powder. Add only Tandoori powder if you want, or add everything oter than tandoori powder if you want - as per your taste.
- And then add some red food colouring so that it becomes fairly red.
- Add some lemon juice to taste if you want to, although the acidity in the paneer should be sufficient.
- Add paneer and mix.
- Keep this for as long as you can - longer the better as the paneer absorbs the masala even more.

Preparation:

- In a frying pan, add some oil (1 tbsp) and saute the capsicum and onion.
- They should remain crisp but should be cooked. Add salt (1/2 tsp), pepper, ajinomoto and a little sugar. Continuously stir as the sugar shouldn't caramelize.
- Remove the vegetables to a plate and in the same pan add oil (1 tbsp) and paneer. Stir and heat to cook in the juice of dahi and paneer until it becomes thick.
- Add the vegetables and cook for a while. Add chaat masala to taste if wanted.
