### Ingredients (Serves 4)

- 1 very large Baigan (Brinjal)
- Oil
- 2 medium Onion
- 2 medium Tomatoes
- Dry masala: 1tsp Jeera powder, 1.25 tsp Dhanya powder, 1.5 tsp Red chilli powder, 0.25 tsp Haldi powder
- 0.5 tsp Pav Bhaji Masala (optional)

### Directions

Cooking the brinjal:

- Take the baigan, coat it with a layer of oil with your hand.
- Roast it on stove on medium or high heat. Keep turning it around every 2-3 minutes while cooking to cook it evenly.
- Stop when it is cooked - It is considered cooked if the skin is crisp on all sides.
- Cut the brinjal and scoop out the insides with a spoon.
- Chop the insides so that it is pulpy and not chunky.

Make the bharta:

- Chop 2 onions and tomatoes very finely
- Take some oil and saute the onions till they are soft, just before they turn brown.
- Add the dry masala and also Pav Bhaji Masala and mix it up.
- Add the tomatoes and stir for a minute or two. Don't need to cook the tomatoes too much.
- Now, add the Brinjal pulp and cook on low flame for 5 minutes until the tomatoes are cooked.
- Garnish with lemon juice for tanginess and coriander leaves for freshness.
