### Ingredients (Serves 4)

- 2 capsicum
- 30 gms cashew nuts (broken)
- 2 small onions
- 5 tbsp curd
- 3 tsp Tandoori Powder
- 1 tbsp Ginger Garlic paste
- 1 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp red food colouring
- 1/2 a lemon's juice
- 4 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp Kasuri methi crushed

### Directions

Cutting:

- Wash the capsicum and cut it so that you get about 12 squarish pieces from each capsicum.
- Take the broken cashew nuts and blend it in a mixer to make a thick paste.
- Take the onions, wash and peel. Cut it into medium pieces and blend it in the mixer. The juice from the onion will make it into a paste.
- Unfreeze the chicken or clean it. Cut it into pieces you'd like in the dish (medium sized pieces)

Marinate the chicken:

- Take the curd in a bowl and
- Add some salt (1/2 tsp), tandoori powder. (In stead of tandoori powder, a combination of Dhanya powder, Haldi powder, Jeera powder and Red chlli powder can also be used)
- Add ginger garlic paste.
- Add red food colouring (1/2 tsp) so it becomes quite dark.
- Add some lemon juice so that it becomes tangy.
- Add chicken and mix.
- Keep this for as long as you can - longer the better.

Preparation:

- Add some oil (1 tbsp) in a pan and saute the capsicum for 2 mins. Add some salt (1/2 tsp). Optionally, aji no moto and sugar can be added to get more flavour.
- Saute till it is cooked but should also be crisp.
- Separate the chicken and the marination gravy.
- In a pan, add 1 tbsp of oil and add the chicken (without marination gravy) to it and cook. This will take about 15-20 mins to cook and will release a lot of water. make sure the water is dried and very thick by the end.
- In a pan, add butter. Put the onion paste in and heat till it turns light brown
- Add the marinating gravy, garam masala and salt (1/2 tsp)
- After mixing, add the Cashew paste and some water. Cook this well so that it's heater but doesn't boil.
- Now, add some red coloring (1/2 tsp) to increase the red colour by the end.
- Add the chicken pieces, the fresh cream and some Kasuri methi. Crush the kasuri methi or powder them before adding. Mix well.
- Add capsicum on top and mix it.
