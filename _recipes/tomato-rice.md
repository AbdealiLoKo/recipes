### Ingredients

- 1.5 cups rice
- 2 tsp oil
- 1 tsp mustard seeds
- 2 medium tomatoes
- 2 medium onions
- 2 green chillies
- 10-20 Curry leaves
- some Coriander leaves
- 1/4 tsp Haldi
- salt to taste

## Directions

The mixture:

- Take the oil and heat it for a few minutes.
- Add a few mustard seeds and check if they splutter (if not, let the oil heat for some more time).
- Add the green chillies, curry leaves, and mustard seeds. Cover so that oil does not splutter out.
- Then add some salt and onion to the oil.
- When the onion is cooked (but not golden/reddish) add tomatoes and mix on high flame for a minute or two. Add the haldi to this.
- Close the lid so that the tomatoes can simmer in it's juice. After the tomatoes are cooked, add coriander leaves and maggi masala.
- Cook for a minute and then add it to the rice.

The rice:

- Take the rice and clean it. Keep it in water for a while to soften it (~30mins to 1hr)
- Put the rice into a rice cooker or heat on the stove with 2.5 times the amount of water (As we used 1.5 cups rice we use ~2.75 cups water). Add salt to the water to taste.
- When the rice is nearly cooked (10 mins before it is done) and when there is still a little moisture in it, add the mixture to it and mix.
- Let it simmer for 10 more minutes and serve.
